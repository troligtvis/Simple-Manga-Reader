# Simple Manga Reader

A simple manga reader written in Swift 2. Fetch a couple of mangas from http://www.mangareader.net/

Code is a mess and was just quick fixed to Swift 2 to make it compile...


Note: The developer of this program are in no way responsible for any content fetched from the website. I do not own any of the manga accessible through the application.
